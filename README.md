## Hi there 👋  

I’m **Mohamed Sheekh**, an MSc Software Engineering student at **Cardiff University**. I’m passionate about building accessible, user-focused applications and exploring how technology can make life simpler and more connected.  


- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving my **full-stack development** skills using **Java** **.NET**, **React.js**, and **SQL**.  
- 🌱 I’m learning more about **cloud deployment** and **DevOps** tools like **Docker** and **Jenkins**.  
- 💬 Ask me about **software engineering**, **Agile development**, or my journey from **Politics and Economics** to **Software Engineering**.  
- 📫 How to reach me: [mohamedsheekh77@outlook.com](mailto:mohamedsheekh77@outlook.com)  
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me watching the **NFL** (huge **Lamar Jackson** fan 🏈), getting lost in a great **TV series**, or reading about **Greek philosophy** and empires like the **Roman** and **Mongol** ones.  And if not any of the above, probably in a coffe shop somehwere in the world ✈️.
